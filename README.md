# Human Breadboard Twister
Final Project for DES INV 23

Our team proposes to create an interactive game (similar to the twister) that helps people learn to circuitry.

## Summary

For our project we are designing 3 devices that only work when (3-4) users step on buttons in order of the flow on an interactive map. In this learning game, the users will learn how to create a circuit for a given output (such as a light display system, a motorized object, and a lcd display). On the matt, there will be images of the electrical components needed to activate the object. The users must step on the components in the order of operation to get the machine to work.
 
The goal of this project is to make something that is inherently impersonal and monotonous and make it human and interactive for learning purposes.

Wires

Contacts

Electronics case

Copper Tape


## Inputs/Outputs/Date

Humans --> copper tape --> currents --> closed cirtuit --> light/data

## Challenges

Figuring out the design/layout of the interface. Getting the technology to work (closing circuits and using humans as resistors). Making it portable.

## Timeline

Week 1: Write proposal

Week 2: Get parts and begin designing circuits. Finalize concept

Week 3: Make prototype for the game that can be tested.

Week 4: Complete the final product.

Week 5: Present!
