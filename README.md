# MOR (Muscle Operated Remote)
Final Project for DES INV 23

Our team proposes to create an interactive game (similar to the classic “Helicopter” concept) using an EMG remote (MyoWare Sensor).

## Summary

The goal of this project is to create a game in which the remote is your body. Using EMG technology, we want to create an interactive remote that responds to electric activity in the users muscle. Additionally, using knowledge we learned from Java, we want to create an addictive, simple, and challenging (as you progress) game in which you can compete for a high score, similar to the classic game Helicopter. Using EMG input data, each time you flex your forearm, the character will move up, but gravity is constantly acting on it. Since this game requires flexing of muscle, it would be interesting to see if players can play as long without a traditional remote (which would use less human activity and energy).

The main goal of our project is to change the way people play video games and get people to use more energy and their body to play a game (compared to traditional remotes).

## Component Parts

MyoWare Muscle Sensor (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13723)

Arduino Uno

Computer/p5 alpha editor

Human being

## Inputs/Outputs/Date

Muscle Activity -> EMG electrode -> MyoWare ->  Arduino -> frequency/value -> Database -> movement in game (dictated by “if statements”)

-> input

-> output

-> data

## Challenges

Getting the technology to work consistently without glitching, as well as obtaining consistent data using the MyoWare. Creating an interface that works between the remote and the game. Additionally, getting all the components to fit into a remote/shell that can fit onto a human arm in a beautiful way.

## Timeline

Week 1: Write proposal

Week 2: Get parts and begin coding the technology. Start coding the interface of the game. Start sketching the design of the shell.

Week 3: Make prototype for the physical shell for the controller that acts as a remote (fits on human arm). Complete the interface of the game

Week 4: Have the shell/remote complete (including the tech). Make sure everything works consistently.

Week 5: Present!
