# Human Breadboard Twister
Final Project for DES INV 23

Our team proposes to create an interactive game (similar to the twister) that helps people learn to circuitry.

## Summary

Using humans (3-4) to make a closed circuit using humans as resistors in a twister inspired way. We want to create something that forces interaction between people in an educational/fun way (and would be super funny to see older people in professional attire play at the final showcase). We intend to design an interface to play the game (such as a monitor that says what to do and how long to do it). We will pre-design 6 circuits that will be randomly selected for users to play and complete. When people close the circuits, they will be rewarded with a happy noise and whatever the circuit is designed to do (for example, something simple like light up an LED) or a buzzer if they fail to complete the circuit in time or incorrectly.
 
The goal of this project is to make something that is inherently impersonal and monotonous and make it human and interactive for learning purposes. Additionally, we could see this project being used at companies for ice-breakers.

## Challenges

Getting the technology to work consistently without glitching, as well as obtaining consistent data using the MyoWare. Creating an interface that works between the remote and the game. Additionally, getting all the components to fit into a remote/shell that can fit onto a human arm in a beautiful way.

## Timeline

Week 1: Write proposal

Week 2: Get parts and begin designing circuits. Finalize concept

Week 3: Make prototype for the game that can be tested.

Week 4: Complete the final product.

Week 5: Present!
