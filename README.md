# Circuit Twister
Final Project for DES INV 23

Our team proposes to create an interactive game (similar to the twister) that helps people learn to circuitry.

## Summary

For our project, we are designing a electrical twister mat responds to CapSense. The objective of the game is to get users to select buttons with designated elctrical components that complete a given ciruit (based on the game). 

The game has multiple levels of difficulty
Each level requires a certain amount of electrical components to make something electrical work (turn on LED, servo motor, etc.)
Each level requires more parts; therefore, making the twister game more difficult and requires more people to select all buttons
Once user/s select all buttons, a noise will sound to tell them that they completeted the circuit
In order to complete a level, all buttons must be pressed for at least 10-15 seconds, making it more difficult to hold the position

The main goal of the project is to introduce people to electrical components involved in ciruitry in a fun and creative way.

## Game Levels

1. LED (Power 3V, ground, resistor, LED)
2. Servo Motor (Power 6V, ground, Arduino, resistor, motor)
3. Brightness Data (3V, ground, arduino, Photoresistor, resistor)
4. LED Fader (Power 3V, ground, resistor, potentiometer, LED, arduino)
5. DC Motor (Power 6V, ground, transistor, DC motor, diod, resistor, arduino)


Total: Power 3V, Power 6V, 2 resistor, LED, Arduino, motor, photoresistor, potentiometer, transistor, DC Motor, diod
12 items total

## Component Parts

Feather
Copper
Foam
LEDs
Wire
Tiny speaker
Canvas/Mat (game-pad)
Printed out graphics for each level (with answers on back)


## Inputs/Outputs/Date

Humans --> copper tape --> closed cirtuit --> light/data --> Wait 15 seconds --> BING!

## Challenges

Figuring out the design/layout of the interface. Getting the technology to work (closing circuits and using humans as resistors). Making it portable.

## Timeline

Week 1: Write proposal

Week 2: Get parts and begin designing circuits. Finalize concept

Week 3: Make prototype for the game that can be tested.

Week 4: Complete the final product.

Week 5: Present!
